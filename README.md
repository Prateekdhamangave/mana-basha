# MANA BASHA 🗣️✨

**Preserving Our Telugu Culture, One Voice at a Time**

---

## 🧠 PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Mana Basha** is a multi-modal, community-driven web platform that invites people to **share, celebrate, and preserve the richness of Telugu language and village culture**. Through stories, memes, audio clips, dialect riddles, and recipes, the platform becomes a living archive for native voices, local creativity, and cultural treasures.

Whether it's a childhood tale from your village, your grandmother's famous pachadi recipe, or a meme in local slang — Mana Basha is your digital village square.
